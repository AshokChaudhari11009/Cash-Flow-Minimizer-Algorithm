# Cash-Flow-Minimizer-Algorithm

## Description

It that helps groups of friends minimize the number of transactions needed to settle debts among themselves. It uses custom implementations of min and max heaps to efficiently calculate the optimal set of transactions.

## Features

- Custom MinHeap and MaxHeap implementations
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Efficient algorithm to minimize the number of transactions
- Handles multiple friends and transactions
